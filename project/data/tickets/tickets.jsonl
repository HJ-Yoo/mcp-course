{"ticket_id": "TKT-001", "title": "Laptop screen flickering after docking", "priority": "high", "body": "My Dell Latitude 5540 (SN: DL5540-2025-4892, Asset Tag: ACME-LT-1247) has been experiencing intermittent screen flickering when connected to my CalDigit TS4 Thunderbolt dock. The flickering occurs on my external Dell U2723QE monitor (connected via USB-C/DisplayPort) approximately every 10-15 minutes and lasts for 2-3 seconds each time. The laptop's built-in display is unaffected.\n\nEnvironment:\n- OS: Windows 11 Pro 24H2 (Build 26100.3194)\n- Intel UHD Graphics driver: 31.0.101.5186\n- Dock firmware: CalDigit TS4 v1.0.28\n- Monitor firmware: Dell U2723QE M2T103\n- USB-C cable: Belkin Thunderbolt 4 cable (2m)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Connect laptop to CalDigit TS4 dock via Thunderbolt 4\n2. External monitor connected to dock via DisplayPort\n3. Set external monitor as primary display at 3840x2160 @ 60Hz\n4. Use normally for 10-15 minutes\n5. Screen flickers/goes black for 2-3 seconds\n\nWhat I've tried:\n- Updated Intel graphics driver to latest version\n- Tried a different USB-C cable (same issue)\n- Reduced refresh rate to 30Hz (flickering stops but unusable)\n- Reset display settings to default\n- Tested with a different dock (Lenovo ThinkPad USB-C Dock) - same issue\n\nThis is significantly impacting my productivity as it interrupts screen recordings and video calls. I'm on the Engineering team (Floor 3, Desk 3-42) and need this resolved ASAP for a client demo next week.", "status": "open", "created_at": "2026-02-18T09:23:00Z", "idempotency_key": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890", "assigned_to": "Marcus Chen"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-002", "title": "Request new headset for remote work", "priority": "low", "body": "Hi IT team,\n\nI recently transitioned to a hybrid schedule (3 days remote per week) and my current headset (Logitech H390 USB) is not cutting it for the volume of video calls I'm on daily (4-6 hours). The microphone picks up too much background noise from my home office and colleagues have complained about audio quality.\n\nI'd like to request a Jabra Evolve2 75 wireless headset with ANC. I've confirmed with my manager (Sarah Kim, Marketing Director) that this is approved. I saw in the inventory that we have stock in HQ-Floor3-IT-Storage.\n\nI'm based at HQ Floor 2, Desk 2-18 on my in-office days (Mon/Tue/Wed). Happy to pick it up from IT whenever it's ready.\n\nThanks!\n- Priya Patel, Senior Marketing Manager", "status": "resolved", "created_at": "2026-02-10T14:15:00Z", "idempotency_key": "b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-bcde-f23456789012", "assigned_to": "IT Equipment Team"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-003", "title": "VPN connection drops every 30 minutes", "priority": "critical", "body": "URGENT: My VPN connection (WireGuard) has been dropping exactly every 30 minutes since Monday (Feb 17). When it drops, I lose access to all internal systems for about 60-90 seconds before it automatically reconnects. This is causing major issues:\n\n- Lost unsaved work in Confluence twice\n- Dropped from 3 client Zoom calls mid-conversation\n- SSH sessions to staging servers killed, disrupting deployments\n- Cannot maintain persistent database connections\n\nMy setup:\n- MacBook Pro 14\" M3 Pro (macOS Sequoia 15.3)\n- WireGuard v1.0.16 (latest from App Store)\n- Home internet: Comcast 500/25 Mbps (stable, tested without VPN)\n- Router: ASUS RT-AX86U (firmware 3.0.0.6.102)\n- Config file: acme-wg-jrodriguez.conf (last rotated Jan 15, 2026)\n\nTroubleshooting already performed:\n1. Restarted WireGuard client multiple times\n2. Rebooted laptop and router\n3. Deleted and re-imported WireGuard config\n4. Tried OpenVPN as fallback - same issue (drops at ~30 min intervals)\n5. Tested on mobile hotspot (iPhone 15, T-Mobile) - SAME ISSUE\n6. Reduced MTU to 1280 - no improvement\n7. Disabled Wi-Fi power saving in System Settings\n8. Checked PersistentKeepalive is set to 25\n\nThe fact that it happens on both WireGuard and OpenVPN, and on both home Wi-Fi and mobile hotspot, suggests the issue might be server-side. Two colleagues on my team (Alex Wu and Dana Park) reported similar issues starting this week.\n\nI'm a Senior DevOps Engineer on the Platform team and this is blocking production deployment work. Please escalate.\n\n- James Rodriguez, Senior DevOps Engineer, Platform Team", "status": "in_progress", "created_at": "2026-02-19T08:45:00Z", "idempotency_key": "c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-cdef-345678901234", "assigned_to": "Network Infrastructure Team"}
