2.3. All expenses must be pre-approved when the policy requires it and submitted for reimbursement in a timely manner.

## 3. Expense Reporting System

3.1. **Concur:** All expense reports must be submitted through **SAP Concur** (accessible via Okta SSO at concur.acmecorp.com). Paper or email submissions are not accepted.

## 4. Receipt Requirements

4.2. **Lost Receipts:** If a receipt is lost, a Lost Receipt Affidavit must be completed in Concur. Repeated lost receipt claims may trigger an audit review.

## 6. Approval Thresholds

6.1. Expense approval follows this hierarchy:

| Total Expense Amount | Required Approver |

| Up to $500 | Direct Manager |
| $501 - $2,000 | Director |
| $2,001 - $5,000 | Vice President |
| Over $5,000 | CFO |

6.2. **Pre-Approval:** Expenses expected to exceed **$1,000** in a single trip or purchase require pre-approval before the expense is incurred. Submit a pre-approval request in Concur with estimated costs.

6.3. **Split Reporting:** Intentionally splitting a single expense across multiple reports to avoid approval thresholds is prohibited and considered a policy violation.
