# Remote Work Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026
**Last Revised:** January 15, 2026
**Policy Owner:** Human Resources, in partnership with IT Operations
**Applies To:** All full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines and expectations for employees who work remotely, whether on a regular hybrid schedule or on an occasional basis. Acme Corp recognizes that flexible work arrangements can improve employee satisfaction, reduce commute times, and support business continuity, while maintaining the collaboration and productivity standards that drive our success.

## 2. Eligibility

2.1. **Probationary Period:** Employees must complete a minimum of 90 calendar days of employment before becoming eligible for remote work. During the probationary period, employees are expected to work on-site full-time to facilitate onboarding, training, and team integration.

2.2. **Role Suitability:** Not all roles are eligible for remote work. Positions that require physical presence (e.g., facilities maintenance, on-site IT support, front desk reception) are excluded. Managers will designate which roles on their team are remote-eligible.

2.3. **Performance Standing:** Employees must be in good standing with no active performance improvement plans (PIPs). Remote work privileges may be revoked if performance falls below expectations.

2.4. **Manager Approval:** All remote work arrangements require written approval from the employee's direct manager and department head. Approval is documented in Workday under the employee's profile.

## 3. Schedule & Availability

3.1. **Hybrid Schedule:** Eligible employees may work remotely up to 3 days per week. The specific remote days must be agreed upon with the employee's manager and should remain consistent week-to-week to support team coordination.

3.2. **Core Hours:** Regardless of location, all employees must be available and responsive during core hours: **9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern Time**, Monday through Friday. Employees in other time zones must adjust accordingly or negotiate alternative core hours with their manager.

3.3. **Slack Status:** Employees working remotely must keep their Slack status updated to reflect their availability. Use the "Working Remotely" status with the house emoji. Set yourself to "Away" during breaks exceeding 15 minutes.

3.4. **Response Time:** Remote employees are expected to respond to Slack messages within 15 minutes during core hours. Email responses should be provided within 2 hours.

3.5. **Calendar Visibility:** Keep your Google Calendar up to date with meetings, focus blocks, and out-of-office time. All calendar events should reflect your actual availability.

   - External monitor (upon request, subject to inventory availability)
   - Keyboard and mouse (upon request)

   - Cable management and accessories
   - Monitor arms or laptop stands
   - Noise-canceling enhancements

   The stipend is disbursed upon remote work approval and is taxable income. Receipts must be submitted through Concur within 60 days of purchase.

This is processed automatically through payroll and appears as a separate line item on your pay stub. A minimum internet speed of 50 Mbps download / 10 Mbps upload is required.

4.4. **Equipment Return:** All company-provided equipment must be returned within 5 business days of employment termination or revocation of remote work privileges. Shipping labels will be provided by IT.

## 5. Workspace Requirements

5.1. **Dedicated Workspace:** Remote employees must maintain a dedicated, private workspace that is free from distractions and suitable for video calls. Shared common areas (e.g., coffee shops, libraries) should not be the primary remote work location.

5.2. **Ergonomic Setup:** Employees are encouraged to set up their workspace following ergonomic best practices. The HR team offers virtual ergonomic assessments upon request.

5.3. **Background & Noise:** During video calls, employees should use a professional background (real or virtual) and minimize background noise. Use the mute button when not speaking in meetings with more than 3 participants.

## 6. Security & Compliance

6.1. **VPN Mandatory:** All remote employees must connect to the Acme Corp VPN before accessing any internal systems, including email, Slack, Jira, Confluence, and internal dashboards. See the VPN Setup & Usage Guide (policy://vpn-guide) for setup instructions.

6.2. **Device Security:** All devices used for work must comply with the Information Security Policy (policy://security-policy):
   - Full disk encryption enabled (FileVault for macOS, BitLocker for Windows)
   - Automatic screen lock after 5 minutes of inactivity
   - Up-to-date operating system and security patches
   - Company-approved antivirus software installed and active

6.3. **Confidential Information:** Employees must not access or display confidential or restricted information in public spaces. Screen privacy filters are recommended for travel or coworking scenarios.

6.4. **Wi-Fi Security:** Employees must use a secured, password-protected Wi-Fi network. Public Wi-Fi networks (hotels, airports, coffee shops) may only be used with an active VPN connection.

## 7. Communication & Collaboration

7.1. **Primary Tools:** The following tools are standard for remote collaboration:
   - **Slack** — real-time messaging and team channels
   - **Google Meet / Zoom** — video conferencing
   - **Google Calendar** — scheduling
   - **Jira** — project and task tracking
   - **Confluence** — documentation and knowledge sharing
   - **GitHub** — source code and code review
   - **Figma** — design collaboration

7.2. **Meeting Etiquette:** Cameras should be on for meetings with 5 or fewer participants, unless bandwidth is an issue. For larger meetings, camera use is optional but encouraged during introductions.

7.3. **Asynchronous First:** Teams are encouraged to default to asynchronous communication (Slack messages, Confluence docs, Loom recordings) and reserve synchronous meetings for discussions that require real-time interaction.

---

## 8. Quarterly In-Office Weeks

8.1. **All-Hands Weeks:** Acme Corp holds quarterly in-office collaboration weeks (typically the second week of January, April, July, and October). All remote-eligible employees are expected to be on-site during these weeks.

8.2. **Travel & Accommodation:** For employees who live more than 50 miles from the nearest Acme Corp office, the company will cover:
   - Round-trip travel (economy airfare or mileage reimbursement)
   - Hotel accommodation for the duration of the in-office week
   - Per diem meals at the standard domestic rate

8.3. **Planning:** In-office week dates are published at least 8 weeks in advance. Employees who cannot attend due to extenuating circumstances must notify their manager and HR at least 3 weeks before the scheduled week.

---

## 9. Performance & Accountability

9.1. **Output-Based Evaluation:** Remote employees are evaluated on deliverables and outcomes, not hours logged. Managers should set clear, measurable objectives and conduct regular 1:1 check-ins (minimum weekly).

9.2. **Self-Reporting:** Employees are responsible for updating Jira tickets and project boards daily to reflect progress. This ensures visibility and supports asynchronous collaboration.

9.3. **Trial Period:** New remote arrangements begin with a 30-day trial period. At the end of the trial, the manager and employee will review the arrangement and decide whether to continue, modify, or discontinue remote work.

---

## 10. Revocation & Exceptions

10.1. **Revocation:** Remote work privileges may be revoked at any time by the employee's manager or HR if:
   - Performance standards are not met
   - Communication or availability expectations are repeatedly unmet
   - Security policy violations occur
   - Business needs require on-site presence

10.2. **Exceptions:** Requests for exceptions to this policy (e.g., more than 3 remote days per week, international remote work) must be submitted to HR in writing and approved by the department VP.

10.3. **International Remote Work:** Working from outside the United States requires prior approval from HR and Legal due to tax, labor law, and data residency implications. Requests must be submitted at least 30 days in advance.
